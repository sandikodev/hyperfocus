## 🎁 The Gift

This is **Sandikodev's 10-year journey gift** to the open-source community—for enthusiasts and beginners who want to learn web technology collaboratively, from the ground up.

**HyperFocus** - The paradox of ADHD: intensely focused on one thing, yet exploring every layer beneath it.

## 🧠 The ADHD Paradox

**HyperFocus** reflects how an ADHD mind works—**never satisfied with understanding just one layer**. We hyperfocus on SnapCode (a simple client-side app), but can't stop exploring everything beneath it:

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="🎨 Client-Side Rendering" icon="laptop">
		Where it all begins. SnapCode: 56KB, buildless, pure browser magic.
	</Card>
	<Card title="🔄 Server-Side Rendering" icon="seti:config">
		When and why we need the backend. Progressive enhancement.
	</Card>
	<Card title="🏗️ Infrastructure" icon="setting">
		Bare metal, containers, orchestration. From VPS to Kubernetes.
	</Card>
	<Card title="🔒 Security" icon="seti:lock">
		Hardening, authentication, best practices. Production-ready.
	</Card>
	<Card title="📊 Monitoring" icon="seti:json">
		Observability, logging, metrics. Know what's happening.
	</Card>
	<Card title="☁️ Cloud & Edge" icon="external">
		Modern deployment strategies. Scale globally.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

Starting with **SnapCode** as our case study—a simple client-side app—we progressively explore:

- Why buildless? When to use build tools?
- Client-side vs Server-side rendering trade-offs
- When to involve the backend
- Infrastructure from scratch to cloud
- Security hardening and best practices
- Monitoring and observability

<Aside type="note">
**We don't stop at one layer. We explore them all.**

That's the paradox: HyperFocus on one thing, but never satisfied until we understand everything beneath it.
</Aside>

## 🎯 For Everyone

### 🌱 Beginners
Start with client-side rendering. Understand the basics. Deploy for free on GitHub Pages. Build confidence.

### 🚀 Intermediate
Explore server-side rendering. Learn infrastructure. Deploy on VPS. Understand trade-offs.

### ⚡ Advanced
Dive into containers, security, monitoring, orchestration. Master DevOps. Scale globally.

<Aside type="caution">
This is a **learning resource**, not production-ready code. Always review and adapt to your specific needs.
