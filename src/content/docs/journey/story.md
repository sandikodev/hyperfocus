description: From SMK to DevOps - A story of passion, mistakes, and persistence
---

## 💫 Dedication

**This project celebrates 10 years (2016-2026) in Computer Science, specializing in Web Technology.**

A journey of passion, mistakes, hard lessons, and unwavering love for the craft—despite all obstacles.

---

## 🎯 The Real Journey

### Early Years: The Foundation

**Childhood**
- Fascinated by computers and assembly
- Built first PC in 2nd grade (SD Kelas 2)
- Intel Pentium 2 with iconic slot RAM
- The spark that started everything

**SMP (Junior High)**
- Active in scientific writing
- Research: Eco-friendly energy (Ethanol gas from tofu waste fermentation)
- Robotics: Automatic door with simple circuits (no microcontroller)

---

### The First Big Mistake: Wrong Decision

**SMA Negeri 3 Bantul - IPS (Social Sciences)**

Why IPS? Not my own decision. Advice: "Career as a trader." Reality: **Wrong path.**

**The Realization (Quarter semester in)**
- Felt completely wrong
- Far from vision: researcher, system designer, developer
- Requested switch to IPA (Natural Sciences) - Approved
- But toxic senior culture + ego = motivation collapsed

**The Dropout #1**
- Stopped school, mental breakdown
- Had to transfer schools, repeat the year
- Forced to make a REAL decision

---

### 2016: The Real Beginning

**SMK Negeri 3 Yogyakarta** - *Teknik Komputer Jaringan*

Why Vocational?
- Aligned with lifelong passion
- Technical skills I already mastered
- A decision I could stand by

**Finally, the right path.**

---

### 2021: The Second Big Mistake

**The Dilemma: Two Universities**

| Amikom Yogyakarta | UIN Sunan Kalijaga |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| My choice | Parents' suggestion |
| Aligned with skills | Not aligned |
| Expensive | Affordable |

**The Overconfident Decision:** "I can do both!"

---

### The Brutal Reality

**2022: Complete Collapse**
- Company bankrupt (bad management)
- Couldn't afford tuition
- UIN: Dropped out Semester 3
- Amikom: Dropped out Semester 5
- Financial disaster, mental breakdown #2

---

### The Pattern: Inconsistency

**The Fatal Flaw**
- Inconsistent decision-making
- Impulsive choices
- Late realizations
- Ego-driven actions

**The Brutal Truth**
- Not good at making money
- Not good at self-branding
- Loved the craft too much
- Forgot to survive

---

## 🧠 2025: The Diagnosis - ADHD

After years of impulsive decisions, inconsistent choices, hyperfocus on passion, ignoring basic needs...

**Finally understood:**
- Not just "bad at decisions"
- **ADHD since childhood**

**The Pattern Makes Sense:**
- SMA IPS → IPA switch (impulsivity)
- Dropout → repeat (inconsistency)
- Double degree attempt (overconfidence)
- Hyperfocus on tech (ignoring survival)
- Poor financial management (executive dysfunction)

---

## 🌟 The Spiritual Awakening: RUH, Mental, and Raga

**RUH (Soul/Spirit)** - The True Self, the consciousness, the decision maker

**Mental (Mind)** - The thoughts, emotions, patterns - *Responsibility of RUH*

**Raga (Body)** - The physical form, actions, health - *Responsibility of RUH*

**Living with Consciousness:**
- Aware of ADHD patterns
- Conscious of impulses
- Responsible for choices
- **RUH in control, not ADHD**

## 💫 Final Words

**Certificates prove attendance.**  
**But knowledge proves capability.**  
**And failures prove resilience.**
